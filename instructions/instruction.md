### 1. Coding standards

We will be following the Google Style Guides as our coding standards. Specifically we will be coding in Java and use the standards described [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

#### 1.1. IntelliJ setup

Download the [google-java-format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) plugin. To trigger the plugin in IntelliJ go to *Code -> Reformat Code*. I also recommended to set the code style settings which help to create properly formatted code as-you-go. 

1. Download [intellij-java-google-style.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml).

2. Go to *File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style*.

3. Click on the wrench icon and import the downloaded file.

4. Make sure that GoogleStyle is chosen as the current Scheme.

Those settings canâ€™t completely mimic the format enforced by the Google Style Guides. So before submitting code, please make sure to run *Reformat Code* and follow the standards as close as possible.
